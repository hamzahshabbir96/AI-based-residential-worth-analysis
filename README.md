# AI Based Residential Price Analysis

Model proposal based on Neural Network for standardization of residential worth by categorizing different impact factors for value addition of residential markets as well as consumer

This project was part of All India PropTech Hackathon by NEC & Mitsubishi in which I was runner up.


* Proposal of a model that is based on Deep Neural Network that considers various factors that has direct or indirect impact on worth of residential property
* Model will also include forecasting model to predict future price of property
* Common platform (Web app) for interaction of developer with buyer
* At the end there will be a web app integrated with Neural network model and machine learning model that will give following output:
* Estimated price range of residential property
* Forecasted Price in future
* Net profit of investment (when to invest, when to sell )
* Graphical and map representation for price comparison
* Environmental scale (can be used to attract buyer)
* Social Scale (can be used to attract buyer)

## backend.py
This script will implement forecasting model for all countries and will forecast result till year as given by input.

## main.py
This script is for creating server for data visualization. This script will take original data from database and create different interactive visulaization. This app has been deployed in Heroku and can be accessed from here: 
[Go to dashboard](https://dashhamzah.herokuapp.com/)

## Energy indicators
Following Energy Indicators has been used for this project:
* Access to Clean Fuels and Technologies for cooking (% of total population)
* Access to electricity (% of rural population with access)
* Access to electricity (% of total population)
* Access to electricity (% of urban population with access)
* Energy intensity level of primary energy (MJ/2011 USD PPP)
* Renewable electricity output (GWh)
* Renewable electricity share of total electricity output (%)
* Renewable energy consumption (TJ)
* Renewable energy share of TFEC (%)
* Total electricity output (GWh)
* Total final energy consumption (TFEC) (TJ)

## Data
Data has been collected from World bank open source databse.
## Optimizations

Time Series model that has been used in this project has been optimzed based on Akaike information criterion(AIC) and Bayesian information criterion(BIC) score.

## Running the app locally


First create a virtual environment with conda or venv inside a temp folder, then activate it.



```bash
virtualenv 
Machine-learning-forecasting-using-SVM-venv

# Windows
ARIMA-model-for-frecasting-of-energy-venv\Scripts\activate
# Or Linux
ARIMA-model-for-frecasting-of-energy-venv/bin/activate

```
Clone the git repo, then install the requirements with pip
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamzahshabbir96/ARIMA-model-for-frecasting-of-energy.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the app and follow local host 
```bash
python index.py
```

## FAQ

#### 1. What this project is about?

Idea of this project is to implement time series model to forecast different energy parameter of the world for example what percent of ppulation will be able to access electricity in future. Time series model includes famous Autoregressive integrated moving average model.
#### 2. Is there any dashboard or visualization to get glimpse of data? 


Yes this app has been deployed for visualization. It can be followed from here : [Go to dashboard website](https://dashhamzah.herokuapp.com/)

#### 3. Does visualization part include forecasted database?

No Visualization only includes data from World databank(original data). Since accuracy of ARIMA model depends on lot of factors such as choosing AR and MA parameter. It has to be manually computed and to avoid wrong interpretations of forecasted data, it was not visually presented.

#### 3. Can I deploy your code?

If you are really interested in this project then you can collab with me and we can furthur improve model. You can reach me by my email hamzahshabbir7@gmail.com or [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamzah-shabbir-108765a5/).
