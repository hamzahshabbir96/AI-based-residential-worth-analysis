# AI Based Residential Price Analysis

Model proposal based on Neural Network for standardization of residential worth by categorizing different impact factors for value addition of residential markets as well as consumer

This project was part of All India PropTech Hackathon by NEC & Mitsubishi in which I was runner up.


* Proposal of a model that is based on Deep Neural Network that considers various factors that has direct or indirect impact on worth of residential property
* Model will also include forecasting model to predict future price of property
* Common platform (Web app) for interaction of developer with buyer
* At the end there will be a web app integrated with Neural network model and machine learning model that will give following output:
* Estimated price range of residential property
* Forecasted Price in future
* Net profit of investment (when to invest, when to sell )
* Graphical and map representation for price comparison
* Environmental scale (can be used to attract buyer)
* Social Scale (can be used to attract buyer)

## Forecasting method
Forecasting consists of hybrid model of machine learning(Random Forest) and time seris forecasting (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). This model will estimate price in future considering past trend and some macro features.

## Forecasting outputs
Forecasting out can give average forecasted price in different regions of India with graphical represenatations.
Other output will be prediction of price.

## FAQ

#### 1. What this project is about?

Idea of this project is to implement time series model to forecast different energy parameter of the world for example what percent of ppulation will be able to access electricity in future. Time series model includes famous Autoregressive integrated moving average model.
#### 2. Is there any dashboard or visualization to get glimpse of data? 


Yes this app has been deployed for visualization. It can be followed from here : [Go to dashboard website](https://dashhamzah.herokuapp.com/)

#### 3. Does visualization part include forecasted database?

No Visualization only includes data from World databank(original data). Since accuracy of ARIMA model depends on lot of factors such as choosing AR and MA parameter. It has to be manually computed and to avoid wrong interpretations of forecasted data, it was not visually presented.

#### 3. Can I deploy your code?

If you are really interested in this project then you can collab with me and we can furthur improve model. You can reach me by my email hamzahshabbir7@gmail.com or [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamzah-shabbir-108765a5/).
